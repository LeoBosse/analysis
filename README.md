You'll find here all the codes that I developped during my PhD and post-doc on night light and auroral emission polarization.

./vendange contains the analysis software for the CRU instruments

./pomerol contains the night light polarization model to compute the Mie and Rayleigh polarization of the night sky in any direction anywhere on Earth.

./geomagic contains usefull routines for 3D geometric computations.
