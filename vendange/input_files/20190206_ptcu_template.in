data_files ptcu/20190202/bb_a90_e45        # List of data files to analyse, NO SPACES, separated by commas.
saving_name 20190202_skibotn_bb_a90_e45 			#Base name for saving figures.

nb_pts_per_rot  500                        #number of points over one rotation of the pola
nb_data_per_rot  6                      #number of data collected every point
rotation_per_sec  2                       #seconds

smoothing_factor 5           #The rotations will be smoothed by this factor. Average over F unit (could be rotations, seconds)
smoothing_unit seconds 						#The unit of the rotation factor (rotations or seconds)
smoothing_method slidding									#Smoothing method. upper: average factor number of rotations -> divides the number of rotations by smoothing_factor! slidding: average each rotation with several next. Does not change the number of rotations!

head_jump 0 					#Number of rotations to skip at the start of the observations
tail_jump 0					#Number of rotations to skip at the end of the observations
jump_unit seconds   #The unit of the head and tail jump (rotations or seconds)
jump_mode time   #If "lenght" -> indicate the lenght of time to be jumped at start or end of obs. If "time", indicate the time (from beginning of obs) at wich to begin or end the obseravtion.

AoLP_correction 0  #AoLP correction to be applied to all AoLP results. Angle in degrees, positive or negative
