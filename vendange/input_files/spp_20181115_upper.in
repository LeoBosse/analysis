smoothing_unit rotations 						#The unit of the rotation factor (rotations or seconds)
smoothing_method upper											#Smoothing method. Upper: average factor number of rotations -> divides the number of rotations by smoothing_factor! Slidding: average each rotation with several next. Does not change the number of rotations!
