data_files False        				# List of data files to analyse, NO SPACES, separated by commas.
saving_name False 							# Base name for saving figures.

observation_type fixed  #Default "fixed". Or "fixed_[elevation, azimut]_[discrete, continue]_rotation"

#observation_type fixed_elevation_continue_rotation  #Default "fixed". Or "fixed_[elevation, azimut]_[discrete, continue]_rotation"
#continue_rotation_elevation 0
#continue_rotation_times 0 #in minutes, Separated by "_".

#discrete_rotation_azimut 0
#discrete_rotation_times 0
#discrete_rotation_elevations 0

pollution_source_azimut 0				# To compute pollution AoLP for a single point source using Rayleigh diffusion theory.
pollution_source_elevation 0		# To compute pollution AoLP for a single point source using Rayleigh diffusion theory.

rotation_per_sec 2 #Rotation speed of the polarizing filter in Hz

smoothing_factor 15           # The rotations will be smoothed by this factor. Average over F unit (could be rotations, seconds)
smoothing_unit seconds 				# The unit of the rotation factor (rotations or seconds)
smoothing_method slidding			# Smoothing method. upper: average factor number of rotations -> divides the number of rotations by smoothing_factor! slidding: average each rotation with several next. Does not change the number of rotations!

head_jump 0					# Number of rotations/time to skip at the start of the observations
tail_jump 0					# Number of rotations/time to skip at the end of the observations
jump_unit seconds   # The unit of the head and tail jump (rotations, seconds, minutes or hours)
jump_mode time   		#If "lenght" -> indicate the lenght of time to be jumped at start or end of obs. If "time", indicate the time (from beginning of obs) at wich to begin or end the obseravtion.

AoLP_correction 0 	# AoLP correction to be applied to all AoLP results. Angle in degrees, positive or negative

time_zone 1  						# UT+X what is the time zone of the observation (UT+1 for France/Norway)? Indicate X
config_time_format LT 	# LT or LT. What did you use for the instrument clock? LT=UT+X is the Local Time of the clock

density_period 0:0_0:0_0:0_0:0 #Indicate the time period the density filter was on. Times are normalized AFTER deleteing the time jumps!!! Separate each channel by a "_" and the start:end by a ":" -> start0:end0_start1:end1_start2:end2_etc...
