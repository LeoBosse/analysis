rotation_per_sec 2 #Rotation speed of the polarizing filter in Hz

smoothing_factor 15           #The rotations will be smoothed by this factor. Average over F unit (could be rotations, seconds)
smoothing_unit seconds 						#The unit of the rotation factor (rotations or seconds)
smoothing_method slidding									#Smoothing method. upper: average factor number of rotations -> divides the number of rotations by smoothing_factor! slidding: average each rotation with several next. Does not change the number of rotations!

head_jump 0					#Number of rotations to skip at the start of the observations
tail_jump 0					#Number of rotations to skip at the end of the observations
jump_unit seconds   #The unit of the head and tail jump (rotations or seconds)
jump_mode time   #If "lenght" -> indicate the lenght of time to be jumped at start or end of obs. If "time", indicate the time (from beginning of obs) at wich to begin or end the obseravtion.

AoLP_correction 0 #AoLP correction to be applied to all AoLP results. Angle in degrees, positive or negative

Imin 0.1 #All measurments with intensity (mV) below will be filtered out
Imax 10000 #All measurments with intensity (mV) above will be filtered out
DoLPmin 0 #All measurments with DoLP (%) below will be filtered out
DoLPmax 100 ##All measurments with DoLP (%) above will be filtered out

I_ref on #on or off. if off, the reference canal of carmen will not be displayed

time_zone 1  #UT+X what is the time zone of the observation (UT+1 for France/Norway)?
config_time_format UT  #UT or LT. What did you use for the instrument clock? LT is the Local Time of the clock
