instrument_name fake_spp             # Name of the instrument we because

data_files spp/fake_spp               # List of data files to analyse, NO SPACES, separated by commas
saving_name 1_percent_1000rot_random_noise_spp 			#Base name for saving figures.


nb_pts_per_rot   80                            #number of points over one rotation of the pola

smoothing_factor 1000              #The data will be smoothed by this factor
smoothing_unit rotations 						#The unit of the rotation factor (rotations or seconds)
smoothing_method Slidding											#Smoothing method. Upper: average factor number of rotations -> divides the number of rotations by smoothing_factor! Slidding: average each rotation with several next. Does not change the number of rotations!

head_jump 0 					#Number of rotations to skip at the start of the observations

jump_unit seconds   #The unit of the head and tail jump (rotations or seconds)


AoLP_correction 0  #AoLP correction to be applied to all AoLP results. Angle in degrees, positive or negative
