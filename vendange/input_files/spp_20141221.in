smoothing_factor 10              #The data will be smoothed by this factor
smoothing_unit rotations 						#The unit of the rotation factor (rotations or seconds)
smoothing_method slidding											#Smoothing method. Upper: average factor number of rotations -> divides the number of rotations by smoothing_factor! Slidding: average each rotation with several next. Does not change the number of rotations!


head_jump 0 					#Number of rotations to skip at the start of the observations
tail_jump 0						#Number of rotations to skip at the end of the observations
