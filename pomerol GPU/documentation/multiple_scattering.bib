  abstract = {In general, the Stocks vector cannot be calculated in reverse in the vector radiative transfer. This paper presents a novel backward and forward Monte Carlo simulation strategy to study the vector radiative transfer in the participated medium. A backward Monte Carlo process is used to calculate the ray trajectory and the endpoint of the ray. The Stocks vector is carried out by a forward Monte Carlo process. A one-dimensional graded index semitransparent medium was presented as the physical model and the thermal emission consideration of polarization was studied in the medium. The solution process to non-scattering, isotropic scattering, and the anisotropic scattering medium, respectively, is discussed. The influence of the optical thickness and albedo on the Stocks vector are studied. The results show that the U, V-components of the apparent Stocks vector are very small, but the Q-component of the apparent Stocks vector is relatively larger, which cannot be ignored.},

  abstract = {Rayleigh-scattering cross sections and volume-scattering coefficients are computed for standard air; they incorporate the variation of the depolarization factor with wavelength. Rayleigh optical depths are then calculated for the 1962 U.S. Standard Atmosphere and for five supplementary models. Analytic formulas are derived for each of the parameters listed. The new optical depths can be 1.3\% lower to 3\% higher at midvisible wavelengths and up to 10\% higher in the UV region compared with previous calculations, in which a constant or incorrect depolarization factor was used. The dispersion of the depolarization factor is also shown to affect the Rayleigh phase function slightly, by approximately 1\% in the forward, backscattered, and 90\textdegree{} scattering-angle directions.},
