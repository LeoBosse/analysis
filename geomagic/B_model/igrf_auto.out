 * December 2014 by the IAGA Working Group V-MOD.     *
 *                                                    *
 * It is valid for dates from 1900.0 to 2020.0,       *
 * values up to 2025.0 will be computed but with      *
 * reduced accuracy. Values for dates before 1945.0   *
 * and after 2010.0 are non-definitive, otherwise the *
 * values are definitive.                             *
